**Last Updated:** December 12, 2025
**Status:** URGENT - Layout broken, reverting bad changes

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL STATUS UPDATE (URGENT!)

**LAYOUT BROKEN ISSUE:**
- Added `add_filter('astra_enable_woocommerce_integration', '__return_false');` to functions.php
- This disabled ALL Astra WooCommerce styling (not just badges!)
- Product grid layout completely destroyed
- **NEED TO REVERT IMMEDIATELY**

**Badge Research Completed:**
- Research shows: Percentage badges convert 20-33% better than "Sale"
- Current problem: TWO badges (Woo Discount Rules + Astra) = clutter penalty
- **Solution:** Keep ONE percentage badge, restyle professionally
- **Do NOT disable Astra WooCommerce integration** (breaks layout!)

**Proper Fix:**
- Use surgical CSS targeting to hide ONLY duplicate badges
- Restyle Woo Discount Rules percentage badge with brand colors
- Keep all other Astra styling intact

**Plugin Sources Found:**
- Green "-20%!" = Woo Discount Rules plugin
- Red "Sale!" = Astra theme
- Settings location: WP Admin → WooCommerce → Discount Rules → Settings → Product

**All Installed Plugins (via Playwright):**
woo-discount-rules, customer-reviews-woocommerce, advanced-woo-search, woocommerce, all-in-one-seo-pack, google-analytics-for-wordpress, astra-sites, jetpack, google-site-kit, wp-smushit, google-listings-and-ads, complianz-gdpr

**WordPress MCP Info:**
- Available at github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter
- Would give direct WordPress access for Claude
- Useful long-term but not urgent

**IMMEDIATE ACTION:**
Revert functions.php filter, implement targeted CSS solution instead
