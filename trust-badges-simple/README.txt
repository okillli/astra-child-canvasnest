SIMPLE TRUST BADGES - NO CSS NEEDED
====================================

STEP 1: REMOVE OLD CODE
------------------------
Go to WordPress Widget and DELETE everything you added before.
This will restore your site layout.

STEP 2: UPLOAD NEW FILES
-------------------------
Upload these 4 files to /wp-content/uploads/trust-badges/:

1. payment-methods-strip.svg (all payment icons in one image)
2. ssl-secure-badge.svg (SSL badge with text)
3. money-back-badge.svg (30-day guarantee with text)
4. secure-checkout-badge.svg (secure checkout with text)

STEP 3: ADD SIMPLE HTML
------------------------
Copy the code from SIMPLE-WIDGET-CODE.html

Paste it into your Custom HTML widget.

That's it! Just 4 images, no CSS conflicts.

FILES:
- payment-methods-strip.svg = 400x60px (all payment methods)
- ssl-secure-badge.svg = 120x120px (green circle with lock)
- money-back-badge.svg = 120x120px (green circle with star)
- secure-checkout-badge.svg = 120x120px (blue circle with shield)

All text is inside the images - no external styling needed!
